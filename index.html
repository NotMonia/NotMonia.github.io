		<h1 style="color:white;">Every day I go to a school
			That likes to help with learnin'
			One two threes, they're the keys
			Basic math, very easy
			To Baldi's world of fun
			Where no one leaves 'til educated
			Every door is locked up tight
			Stay inside, 'til we're graded
			The students try their best to
			Better their education
			Comprehend the material
			Study hard, relay every detail
			Nobody wants detention
			We only want attention
			Even when life is tough
			Oddly quarters are enough
			This is how we live our lives searchin'
			For the answers inside of every page
			And I'm here wonderin' if one day
			We'll finally be free from this cage
			Is it okay to have a feelin'
			That maybe there is more to this game?
			However now, no time to question
			So just behave
			Walking across the hallways
			Finding notebooks so we matter
			Follow every single rule
			Or he'll take out his wooden ruler
			For he is listenin' and
			Watchin' everyone's progression
			All mistakes have consequences
			So, answer right with every question
			Try to add up excuses
			Nothing will make a difference
			Baldi knows every door that we open
			Followin' from behind, we can hear him
			There is no place for playtime
			Avoid them all from every side
			Better to leave him be
			Follow his philosophy
			This is how we live our lives searchin'
			For the answers inside of every page
			And I'm here wonderin' if one day
			We'll finally be free from this cage?
			Is it okay to have a feelin'
			That maybe there is more to this game?
			However now, just keep behaving
			Sweep through the halls
			To escape will have some sacrifices
			No room for jealousy
			I've got no time to play hide and seek
			'Cause eventually he'll surely find me
			Have to be brave or better keep behavin'
			Count 'til I don't know what counts
			Every inch of fear is all that's ingrained
			Can't understand, what's the solution?
			The problem is the mess in my brain
			I'm pushed around with all the pressure
			To be here when I don't wanna stay
			There's gotta be some sort of exit
			To get away</h1>
